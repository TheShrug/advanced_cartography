# "raws" Screenshot Output Folder

When a game is started, a new folder containing that session's seed and any relevant tags will be created here, within that folder a subfolder with the index of the current session (0 if its the first time playing this seed, 1 if the second, etc.) will be created, and in there the screenshots will be stored.
