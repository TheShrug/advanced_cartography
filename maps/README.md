# "maps" Map Output Folder

When a game is started, a new folder containing that session's seed and any relevant tags will be created here, and maps written by stitcher.exe or stitch2.py will be stored here, unless another Output folder is specified. Currently specifying other output folders is only possible by using the stitch2 python script directly, in the future an "advanced" version of stitcher.exe might make this possible.
